Welcome to simple fighter, my own spinnoff to games such as scrolling battels and other offline shooters.
Intruduction.
Simple fighter is just your usual hack and slash shooter, but with a plesent twist to make it seem more enjoyable for others to play. In this game, you're objective is to survive endless hords of enemies and other surprises that may come your way the heigher you progress. I figured since there were a milion other titles out there, I thought, why not make my own version of it for the hell of it? Don't ask me why I called it the way it is. I couldn't come up with a better name for what to call this thing, so hear we are.
