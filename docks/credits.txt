I'd like to thank the folowing people for helping me bring my game into existence.

A huge thanks goes out to my friend Kitsune for his briliont ideas and amence insperation to keep this game going. You never ran out of ideas to suggest and develop wonderful things. Without you, I wouldn't of been able to figure out what else I could've possibley implemented to make this game more entertaining. So thanks again for that.

A big thanks goes out to my friend Masonasons for providing me the improved version of dlg and m_pro. Without those, my game would've kept freezing do to music and sound issues. You also helped me out with lots of code optimizations along the way, and I'm very thankfull for that as well.

Thanks goes to Nikita K for the huge help with Optimizing the code in various areas of the game, and writing some extra map functions for me, especially in the builder menu.

Thanks goes to Parker Watson for the huge help with the game. Mainly fixing character creation, weapon parsing, map making, and lot's of other small things along the way. I really apprishiated all of your wonderful support. You're awsome!

Last but not least, thanks goes out to all of the other Beta testers who played my game. All of your feadbacks were highly valued and welcomed. This game would've never been what it is today if it weren't for your guy's support and suggestions.
