You can now build safe zones in the builder menu. They will also be written to the map you're currently working on.
Improved wall detection for animals, bosses, enemies, robots, and zombies.

Helpers can now damage bosses.
Fixed lots of bugs related to the movement lojic for animals, bosses, enemies, robots, and zombies.
Implemented wall detection for projectiles.

Vehicles can now be seen with the spire.
Made it so npcs don't hit you while you are in a vehicle. Instead, they will damage your vehicle when they find that you are in one.
Resolved an issue where you were still able to move while a lockable door was moving you.
Addressed some issues related to updating the stats of characters, shields, and weapons to their respected files when upgraded in the points menu.
Made it so you can't switch to a different shield while the current shield is being drawn. You were able to switch to a different shield in the past, but only if you weren't razing or wearing that shield.

These folders can include sub-packs for added flexibility as well. You're no longer restricted to the main sounds folder. They can now be placed at the main folder level, giving you full control over how your sounds are organized.
new in 4.4

Thanks to the newly created slider class that will handel all of this with a breez. You can also press the home and end keys to directly jump to the minimum and maximum values of a Parameter you're curren'tly focused on.
new in 4.1
Started working on slider support for adjusting effect parameters.
Fixed a bug where hazards would spawn random ledge platforms on both sides that were different than the ones spesified on the left side of the hazard.

Optimized the reverb handler class to support multiple sound pools at once.
Fixed character stats not saving properly upon choosing them from the settings menu and saving the settings to restart the game.
Fixed sounds not pausing or resuming correctly upon defining sound pools for different type of sounds.

Improved fading pitch in all sound_pools. Instead of immediately dropping the pitch to 100 to start fading it, it will start to fade the pitch if it finds a sound higher than the value specified. This is useful for sounds that have a higher pitch set, especially when building sound related objects in the builder menu.
Added the ability to configure the skip amount when pressing or holding the Up and Down arrow keys in menus. You can find this option in the settings menu. This is mainly useful for large menu lists that take a long time to scroll through. For example, platform/wall selections, music/sound source selections, and other menus that have lots of items in them. Setting a higher number will help you get through those menus quicker.

Added typing sounds to the text input class. These will be used later on.
Replaced the vertualizer class with a much better text input class.
Cleared lots of unneeded sounds that were found in the encripted misc sounds file. The game should now load much faster when compiled as an executable script.

Platforms, staircases, and walls will now get written to the map file you're currently building in.
Adjusted fall damage. If you fall from 8 tiles or more, your health will be deducted based on how high you fell. This will be multiplied by 21. For example, if you had 1000 health, and you fell 8 tiles, your health would be subtracted by 8, which would normaly be 992, but if you times that by 21, you'll actually have 832 health, or 83.2 percent of your maximum health.

I didn't realize this sound belonged to some code I previously implemented that would drop the user after 60 seconds if they were in the air for too long. In any case, this code has been removed.
You can no longer jump or climb staircases while sitting. Idk how that was even possible to begin with.
Addressed an issue where the death dialog would continuesly pop up after you have died in the builder mode.

Recoded jumping and falling to work better with platforms, staircases, and walls.
Recoded the intire map system.
new in 1.7
You can now download all of the sounds right from within the game! When you open it for the first time, it will ask you if you want to download them or not. I recommend pressing yes on that, otherwise the game will run without them, which wouldn't be good. You may also have to extract the sounds yourself, as I don't have a way to automaticly extract it and put them where they belong.
Addressed an issue pertaining to question based menus playing music when they weren't supposed to.
Cleaned up the menu code, again. Apparently I loved to cludder up things in their lol.

The maps menu now only speaks the base name of the map file, rather than apending an extencion to the end of it.
new in 1.6
Fixed maps not being able to load propperly after they have been built within the main map menu of the game. If you've built a map with a name such as main, with the maximum length and height set to 50, and with the tile set to anything you want, you'll now be able to load it back from within the load maps menu for easy retreivel.
Made it so when you press R while a weapon with ammo is loaded, it doesn't reload it when there's already a set amount of ammo in it. From now on, you can only reload the weapon if the loaded ammo reaches 0 for that particular weapon.
Cleaned up lots of code related to playing sounds if an error occured anywear in the game. Dialogs will now play those sounds instead of the normal sound_pool.
The statistics menu intro will now tell you how many entries there are Available to view upon launching it.
You can now view the folowing statistics. Current location, current overall health, maximum jumpheight, maximum X position, maximum Y position, current level/experience, current amount of points, and total kills for all enemies. More may be added soon.
Added a pause menu to all of the game modes. This let's you view statistics right from within the menu, and resume the game when needed.

The level up sound will now play by default. I forgot why it was disabled to begin with.
You can now upgrade your shield's defence in the points menu.
Maps automaticly get written to a file when creating new maps for easy access when you want to load them back.
Fixed maps not loading propperly. I accidentally put .map in place of the file open function when trying to load it. Instead of saying test.map, it said test.map.map.
new in 1.4
Completely ilimenated the old clunky map parser that was used in the save data class. I forgot to get rid of the settings and reset functions for it. Woops.
You can now finally create your own maps with a file and load it into the game for use. As of right now, you can only spawn platforms, starecases, and walls, but more will be added later as time goes on. There's also a test map found in data/maps. Check it out!
Made the toggle anouncements less verbose in the settings menu. Instead of saying something like, up and down in all menus enabled, or up and down in all menus disabled, it will now say something like, up and down enabled, or up and down disabled.
Fixed lots of issues related to the settings menu of the game. You can now enable and disable all of the items in their like normal, and it will instently take effect the next time you save your settings and reopen the game.
You can now spawn walls independent of platforms in the builder menu. I know you could already do that, but I decided to seperate walls from platforms in the code for better organization.
Ripped out the dummy map parser that was used by the save data class. I'm going to start working on a real map parser that hopefully works to load and save maps of all lengths. The old map system was just a glorified save file that was loaded every time I called the read_map function when loading a map from the map.dat file.
Added the ability to load and save boolion variables to Mason's save data class.
Addressed an issue where hrtf refused to be saved after it's been toggeled on or off in the settings menu.

Removed the letter U key from the readme file, as it was no longer being used in the game. This key may have other uses in the future.
Removed the dockumentation menu. I thought this would be useful to read dockuments in the docks folder, but it had a line limmit put in place of files that were 10000 characters or longer.
Asined a default weapon category and type to all of the game modes.
Asined a default character to all of the game modes.
Did some more cleanup in all of the menus.
Finished parsing melee weapons. They can now be viewable in the weapons menu with their stats.
Finished parsing explosive weapons. They can now be viewable in the weapons menu with their stats.
Finished parsing artillery weapons. They can now be viewable in the weapons menu with their stats.
Finished parsing archery weapons. They can now be viewable in the weapons menu with their stats.
Fixed the errors given when you tried starting one of the normal game modes.

Added the ability to speak weapon atributes such as attack, range, level etc.
You can now asine atributes to weapons! You can find their info at data/layouts/equipments/weapons/weapontype/your weapon.
Moved the characters menu to the main settings menu of the game. The letter U key is no longer used to select your character.
Addressed an issue where if you opened the game and tried playing one of the modes, nothing in the character files would be parsed unless you directly whent into the characters menu and chose something in their that would trigger it to be reparsed.
Fixed some typos in the readme. D was supposed to be used to increase your moving speed, not S.
Added the ability to speak atribute info of a character file when you hover over it in the characters menu. Thanks again to Parker Watson for the help in extensively testing the thing. There were so many issues with the menu callback function that I decided to take matters into my own hands and whent threw all of the menu functions that were being used in other menus I implemented to figure out what was wrong with it.
Recoded character parsing. Thanks goes to Parker Watson for the huge help. I initially didn't ask for it, but I'm grateful nonetheless. I admit it was probably a bit messy to go through looking back at it lol.
Added the maps folder. This will be used in the future to make and save maps to a file.
Added error checking to menu sounds.
Added lives and points into all of the character's files. Lives is used in the game to tell you how many lives you have before the game officially ends. Points is used in the game for upgrading purposes. The higher the value, the more you'll have to put into your stats.
new in 1.1
Added the ability to asine atributes to characters with a file. You can find this under data/layouts/characters/your character. More will be coming soon!
Reorganized the data folder a bit, and added the folowing folders. The saves folder will now contain everything to do with saving data related to the actuall game and it's prefferences. The layouts folder will now contain everything to do with making files related to actions performed in all of the game modes. You'll soon be able to asine atributes to different types of characters, weapons, NPCS, and shields with there respected files.
Cleaned up some menu code in the settings porssion of the game.
Sounds no longer destroy themselves after spawnning a vehicle on the map.
You can now enable and disable global hrtf support in the settings menu.
Made it so items in your inventory heal you a sertain percentage of your health, rather than healing you by 1 every time.
Added more error checking to sounds, especially in the normal game modes.
Removed saving of maps for now, as I still need to test it's capabilities, possibley replacing it altogether.
Finally added keyboard documentation in the readme! This took me super duper long to do, but was worth every bit of my tired aking brain so early in the morning. If I've missed anything, please let me know asap!
Fixed a critical runtime error caused by the bullets class. I had to go in their and change all of the continue statements to return ones. My bad on that one lol.
new in 1.0
Finally fixed the game severely lagging when too many objects spawned on the map. From now on, you can't have more than 50 animals, enemies, projectiles, robots, and zombies at once on any of the game modes being played. This also applies to the builder mode as well.
Addressed an ishue regarding bullit loop sounds still playing if the bullet's range has exceeded it's maximum value. The bullet loop sounds for archery, artillery, and explosive weapons should destroy propperly upon firing bullets with very little range to them.
Maps can no longer be built without platforms. If you tried building a map, it will alert the user that there aren't any platforms available to view, therefore bringing them back to the map menu in the process.
Recoded error checking for all sounds! If the game can't find what it's looking for in any of the folders given, it will raze an error, rather than letting the user continue dooing the task that has been requested, such as building an object, using weapons and shields, choosing characters etc.
You can now upgrade your horizontal and vertical weapon ranges in the points menu.
Finally fixed weapon ranges! Bullets will no longer travel untill the end of a boundry unless you're close to it. Your horizontal and vertical weapon ranges will determine where the bullets will end up on the map.
Redesigned the points menu. Instead of bringing up a menu to perchis the amount of points you want to buy for that particular upgrade, it will now bring up an input box that let's you type the number of points you want to invest in that upgrade, such as attack and defence. You no longer need to worry about the game crashing if you have too many points.
Added loop sounds to all of the explosive weapons.
Added ricochet sounds to all of the melee weapons.
Added ricochet, reload, and shell  sounds to all of the artillery weapons.
Fixed other sounds destroying itself in the bullet class, especially when they bounce off walls.
Fixed an issue where bullets kept bouncing endlessly when they had knoware else to go, especially if you jumpped while it was moving to the right or left. Bullets now destroy themselves after reaching the end of a boundary. As long as there's a wall on either side of you, they will still bounce off of it.
Redesigned the way bullets function. Not only they bounce off of walls, they can actualy come back the other way and hit you if you're in the way of them while they're traveling. Dodging is possible, depending on where they come from.
Made it so bullets destroy themselves after hitting a wall or a boundry.
You can now asine ids to reverb effects.
Addressed an ishue pertaining to weapon ammo clearing itself after a melee weapon has been selected. You can now reload all weapons with ammo normaly.
Added hrtf and reverb support to all game elements. The folowing parameters can be adjusted for building a reverb effect. Dry, from 0.1 to 1.0, wet, from 0.1 to 1.0, room_size, from 0.1 to 1.0, dampping, from 0.1 to 1.0, and width, from 0.1 to 1.0. As of right now, you can only spawn one of them at a time. Untill I find a way to fix this, you may have to destroy the map and rebuild the effect from scratch, if you want it someware else on the map.
Finally added vehicles. This took an extremely long time to make. To get inside of one, make sure you are neare it, and press enter to start it up. It will go at speed 5 by default. To stop the vehicle from moving, press enter again. To increase/decrease the speed, press up or down arrows. To turn the vehicle, press left or right arrows. To honk your horn, press space.
Added the upgrade points menu to all game modes. You can increase the folowing stats while playing the normal/custom mode. attack, defence, health, ammo, and shield strength. The more points you have after leveling up, the more you can invest in your upgrades. Your attack will increase the overall damage of all weapons. Your defence will increase the overall resistance of your character, making it so enemies can't easyly hurt you.
Added the object info menu to all game modes. The folowing objects can be viewed. Animals, enemies, projectiles, robots, and zombies. These will tell you where they are in relationship to you, and there overall health in percentages when viewed in the menu.
