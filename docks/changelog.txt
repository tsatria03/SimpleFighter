You can also press the home and end keys to directly jump to the minimum and maximum values of a Parameter you're curren'tly focused on.
New in 4.1.
Started working on slider support for adjusting effect parameters.
Fixed a bug where hazards would spawn random ledge platforms on both sides that were different than the ones spesified on the left side of the hazard.

You no longer need to enter the minimum and maximum health of objects that take them. The builder prompt will only ask you for the actual health of the object, such as 1, 2, 3 etc. The minimum and maximum health will automaticly be filled out upon building the object.
Made it so pressing a key on the number row multiple times doesn't overlap the drawing sound for the weapon that you've equipped.
Weapons will now reset their stats upon selecting one with the number row. This is especially true with those that take ammo.
You can no longer equip weapons with the number row if you are using an item in the items menu.

Documentation versions can now be read by a file without having to modify the code directly. This file can be found under the docks folder of the game. The version.txt file will be altered any time I update the change log file.
Platforms, staircases, and walls will now get written to the map file you're currently building in.
Adjusted fall damage. If you fall from 8 tiles or more, your health will be deducted based on how high you fell. This will be multiplied by 21. For example, if you had 1000 health, and you fell 8 tiles, your health would be subtracted by 8, which would normaly be 992, but if you times that by 21, you'll actually have 832 health, or 83.2 percent of your maximum health.
You can now jump up the staircase by pressing the spacebar. This is useful if you want to get up their faster without having to climb up one step at a time.

Removed the keys grave, 1, 2, and 3 for spying. These keys are now replaced by the shift and arrow keys to spy left, right, up, and down.
Addressed an issue pertaining to one of the other game modes playing a random continuous fall sound unless the user exited it and whent back to the game's menu. I didn't realize this sound belonged to some code I previously implemented that would drop the user after 60 seconds if they were in the air for too long. In any case, this code has been removed.
You can no longer jump or climb staircases while sitting. Idk how that was even possible to begin with.
Addressed an issue where the death dialog would continuesly pop up after you have died in the builder mode.
Fixed an issue where you were able to jump while being on top of a staircase. From now on, if you are on the stairs, you won't be able to jump. Instead, you'll have to climb it like a normal flight of stairs.

Recoded jumping and falling to work better with platforms, staircases, and walls.
Recoded the intire map system.
New in 1.7.
You can now download all of the sounds right from within the game! When you open it for the first time, it will ask you if you want to download them or not. I recommend pressing yes on that, otherwise the game will run without them, which wouldn't be good. You may also have to extract the sounds yourself, as I don't have a way to automaticly extract it and put them where they belong.
Addressed an issue pertaining to question based menus playing music when they weren't supposed to.
Cleaned up the menu code, again. Apparently I loved to cludder up things in their lol.
Added a prompt to all buildable npcs that asks if you want any of them to folow you up on platforms or not. This is useful for making higher floors on the map, and you want them to stay down at the bottom.
Added back the select character type option into the main settings menu.
Character selections and their attributes can finally be saved! Sorry if it took me an extremely long time to debug the issue. All of them can now be modified and ran like normal.
You can now view how much ammo you have left for weapons that take it in the statistics menu.
You can now view how many enemies have spawned on the map while playing one of the other game modes in the statistics menu. These stats will only apply to playing the other two game modes, not the actual builder mode.
You can now view how long you've been playing the game in the statistics menu.
The maps menu now only speaks the base name of the map file, rather than apending an extencion to the end of it.
New in 1.6.
Fixed maps not being able to load propperly after they have been built within the main map menu of the game. If you've built a map with a name such as main, with the maximum length and height set to 50, and with the tile set to anything you want, you'll now be able to load it back from within the load maps menu for easy retreivel.
Made it so when you press R while a weapon with ammo is loaded, it doesn't reload it when there's already a set amount of ammo in it. From now on, you can only reload the weapon if the loaded ammo reaches 0 for that particular weapon.
Cleaned up lots of code related to playing sounds if an error occured anywear in the game. Dialogs will now play those sounds instead of the normal sound_pool.
The statistics menu intro will now tell you how many entries there are Available to view upon launching it.
You can now view the folowing statistics. Current location, current overall health, maximum jumpheight, maximum X position, maximum Y position, current level/experience, current amount of points, and total kills for all enemies. More may be added soon.
Added a pause menu to all of the game modes. This let's you view statistics right from within the menu, and resume the game when needed.

New in 1.4.
Completely ilimenated the old clunky map parser that was used in the save data class. I forgot to get rid of the settings and reset functions for it. Woops.
You can now finally create your own maps with a file and load it into the game for use. As of right now, you can only spawn platforms, starecases, and walls, but more will be added later as time goes on. There's also a test map found in data/maps. Check it out!
Made the toggle anouncements less verbose in the settings menu. Instead of saying something like, up and down in all menus enabled, or up and down in all menus disabled, it will now say something like, up and down enabled, or up and down disabled.
Fixed lots of issues related to the settings menu of the game. You can now enable and disable all of the items in their like normal, and it will instently take effect the next time you save your settings and reopen the game.
You can now spawn walls independent of platforms in the builder menu. I know you could already do that, but I decided to seperate walls from platforms in the code for better organization.
Ripped out the dummy map parser that was used by the save data class. The old map system was just a glorified save file that was loaded every time I called the read_map function when loading a map from the map.dat file.
Added the ability to load and save boolion variables to Mason's save data class.
Addressed an issue where hrtf refused to be saved after it's been toggeled on or off in the settings menu.

Addressed an ishue regarding bullit loop sounds still playing if the bullet's range has exceeded it's maximum value. The bullet loop sounds for archery, artillery, and explosive weapons should destroy propperly upon firing bullets with very little range to them.
Maps can no longer be built without platforms. If you tried building a map, it will alert the user that there aren't any platforms available to view, therefore bringing them back to the map menu in the process.
Recoded error checking for all sounds! If the game can't find what it's looking for in any of the folders given, it will raze an error, rather than letting the user continue dooing the task that has been requested, such as building an object, using weapons and shields, choosing characters etc.
You can now upgrade your horizontal and vertical weapon ranges in the points menu.
Finally fixed weapon ranges! Bullets will no longer travel untill the end of a boundry unless you're close to it. Your horizontal and vertical weapon ranges will determine where the bullets will end up on the map.
Redesigned the points menu. Instead of bringing up a menu to perchis the amount of points you want to buy for that particular upgrade, it will now bring up an input box that let's you type the number of points you want to invest in that upgrade, such as attack and defence. You no longer need to worry about the game crashing if you have too many points.

Added ricochet, reload, and shell sounds to all of the artillery weapons.
Fixed other sounds destroying itself in the bullet class, especially when they bounce off walls.
Fixed an issue where bullets kept bouncing endlessly when they had knoware else to go, especially if you jumpped while it was moving to the right or left. Bullets now destroy themselves after reaching the end of a boundary. As long as there's a wall on either side of you, they will still bounce off of it.
Redesigned the way bullets function. Not only they bounce off of walls, they can actualy come back the other way and hit you if you're in the way of them while they're traveling. Dodging is possible, depending on where they come from.
Made it so bullets destroy themselves after hitting a wall or a boundry.

Addressed an ishue pertaining to weapon ammo clearing itself after a melee weapon has been selected. You can now reload all weapons with ammo normaly.
Added hrtf and reverb support to all game elements. The folowing parameters can be adjusted for building a reverb effect. Dry, from 0.1 to 1.0, wet, from 0.1 to 1.0, room_size, from 0.1 to 1.0, dampping, from 0.1 to 1.0, and width, from 0.1 to 1.0. As of right now, you can only spawn one of them at a time.
